# üöÄ Scalable Web Application Deployment with Auto Scaling and Load Balancing

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **Scalable Web Application** on **AWS Cloud Infrastructure** utilizing key services like **EC2**, **RDS**, **IAM**, **CloudWatch**, **SNS**, **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, and **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**.

The application is a **simple login form** (`index.html`, `style.css`, `form.php`) hosted on **EC2 instances**. Upon submitting the form, user data is securely stored in a **MySQL database on Amazon RDS**. The architecture ensures **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **scalability** by automatically adding/removing instances based on load.
